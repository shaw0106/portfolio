          I follow a repeatable process that includes research, empathy, ideation, wireframes, testing and a final design.

          Through this process my focus is on enhancing user satisfaction by improving the
          usability, accessibility, and pleasure of using an app, website or product. Depending on the project the process is flexible and can be iterative or can include added steps.

              After I've identified the problem I begin broad research and narrow down the information to reflect the target audience.
              With Ruby I first researched Alzheimerz and Dementia, narrowing the research to the aftermath of an elder wandering or becoming lost. I then researched GPS tracking
              devices and their effectivness.

                With a better understanding of the needs of the users, in this case, family and caretakers of elders who wander or become lost,
                I took my research and applied it to my user stories to get a
                diverse set of user needs and narrow down my target audience.
                <br><br>
                I created an empathy map to understand what my users say, do,
                think and how they feel. From this I can gain insight into a day in the life of my user which helps me understand them emotionally.
                <br><br>
                Using the insights I have gained I prioritize a list of needs
                that will later be used to mould the features and functions of my app.

                    In this part of the process I break down the flow and features

                    define the necessary elements that will follow through into the wireframes.

                    I get out my sketch book and begin building the basic pieces

                    the logo and went through the process of creating a brand identity for the app.

                      For each screen I again break down and prioritize the user needs
                      related to each feature. With the components prioritized I can determine placement and function.

                        Testing is really important to me because it gives such valuable feedback on the realistic way a user will use your app, website or product.
                        I always find myself pleasantly surprised at the results of testing.
                        <br><br>
                        Using a low fidelity paper phone prototype and paper I test
                        my low fidelity wireframes with peers, family and friends
                        to get basic feedback about the usability and experience.
                        Using the feedback gathered with testing and surveys I
                        enhance the design and move into a more detailed wireframe using Adobe Illustrator or
                        Adobe Experience Design.
                        I would then test again with Invision or XD and a more targeted demographic, gather feedback and make final improvements.

                        <p class="soon">
                          The problem was that family members and
                          caretakers need a way to track elders who wander or become lost to keep them safe.
                          I created Ruby, a smart tracking device and app that allows you to track your elderly
                          loved one in real time with a GPS enabled bracelet.
                          <br><br>
                          From my research I gathered that 3 in 5 elders with Dementia or Alzheimer will wander,
                          and that if not found within 24 hours 50% of elders who become lost are seriously injured.  To me this is a serious issue with a simple solution.
                          With Ruby you set up a safe zone in which the elder can move freely and set the check in
                          frequency to record the GPS location and time of entry.
                          <br><br>
                          If the elder leaves the safe zone the user is notified through text message, and push
                          notification and the GPS location is given to the user upon opening the app.  Using the
                          home page to orient themselves the user can gather the location, and past locations of the lost elder and track them down quickly and accurately.
                          <br><br>
                          From here the user will want to contact loved ones, emergency numbers or doctors in order to locate and care for the lost elder. With a swipe to the left the emergency contacts that the user has input and ordered appear with simple tap buttons for phone contact.
                          If the user is close to the location of the lost elder and encounters people you can swipe right to access the photo and important info of the lost elder in order to show and engage with those around you.
