            <p class="soon">Hedgecetera is a local business that takes care of hedges,
              trees and clean ups of properties. They requested that the logo be simple and timeless and emphasized the
              the need to stay away from landscaping cliches.
              <br><br>
              My solution was a timeless word mark and in a deep green complimented
              by a light green to really drive home the outdoor nature of the business.
              I designed the website to be responsive and take care of all the questions a homeowner might have before hiring a landscaping company.
              <br><br>
              Next came the flyers, business cards and letterhead. I used a photo that they had taken of a job they had completed and kept the cards and flyers concise and precise.
              The information the client needs and contact numbers are included on both sides with information on services available.
