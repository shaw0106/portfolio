              I then researched at length, dementia, alzhiemers, caretakers,

                I took my research and applied it to my user stories to get a

                I created an empathy map to understand what my users says, does,
                thinks and how they feel. From this I can gain insight into a day in the life of my user which helps me understand them emotionaly.

                          The original problem was that Family members and
                          caretakers need a way to track elders who wander or become lost to keep them safe.
                          I created Ruby, a smart tracking device and app that allows you to track your elderly
                          loved one in real time with a GPS enabled bracelet.
                          <br><br>
                          From my research I gathered that 3 in 5 elders with Dementia or Alzheimer will wander,
                          and that if not found within 24 hours 50% of elders who become lost are seriously injured.  To me this is a serious issue with a simple solution.
                          With Ruby you set up a safe zone in which the elder can move freely and set the check in
                          frequency to record the GPS location and time of entry.
                          <br><br>
                          If the elder leaves the safe zone the user is notified through text message, and push
                          notification and the GPS location is given to the user upon opening the app.  Using the
                          home page to orient themselves the user can gather the location, and past locations of the lost elder and track them down quickly and accurately.
                          <br><br>
                          From here the user will want to contact loved ones, emergency numbers or doctors in order to locate and care for the lost elder. With a swipe to the left the emergency contacts that the user has input and ordered appear with simple tap buttons for phone contact.
                          If the user is close to the location of the lost elder and encounters people you can swipe right to access the photo and important info of the lost elder in order to show and engage with those around you.
