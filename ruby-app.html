          I follow a repeatable process that is crucial for a successful project

              First I researched a veriety of smart objects and decieded I wanted to also follow the underlyng principle that the smart object and app must provide geniuine value to the world.  This underlying principle lead me to the medical feild where a smart object and paired app could benifit people.s health and wellbeing.
              <br><br>
              I then researched at length, dementia, alzhiemers, caretakers,
              statistics on elders who become lost and best practices for finding
              lost elders. This help me understand the potential needs of my user.

                      related to each feature. With the components prioritized I can determine placement and function.

                        <p class="soon">
                          The original problem was that Family members and
                          caretakers need a way to track elders who wander or become lost to keep them safe.
                          I created Ruby, a smart tracking device and app that allows you to track your elderly
                          loved one in real time with a GPS enabled bracelet.
                          <br><br>
                          From my research I gathered that 3 in 5 elders with Dementia or Alzheimer will wander,
                          and that if not found within 24 hours 50% of elders who become lost are seriously injured.  To me this is a serious issue with a simple solution.
                          With Ruby you set up a safe zone in which the elder can move freely and set the check in
                          frequency to record the GPS location and time of entry.
                          <br><br>
                          If the elder leaves the safe zone the user is notified through text message, and push
                          notification and the GPS location is given to the user upon opening the app.  Using the
                          home page to orient themselves the user can gather the location, and past locations of the lost elder and track them down quickly and accurately.
                          <br><br>
                          From here the user will want to contact loved ones, emergency numbers or doctors in order to locate and care for the lost elder. With a swipe to the left the emergency contacts that the user has input and ordered appear with simple tap buttons for phone contact.
                          If the user is close to the location of the lost elder and encounters people you can swipe right to access the photo and important info of the lost elder in order to show and engage with those around you.
