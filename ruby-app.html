          I follow a repeatable process that is crucial for a successful project
          and enhances user satisfaction and value by setting the priority of
          features through detailed research, ideation, empathy, testing and design.
          <br><br>
          Through this process my focus is on enhancing user satisfaction by improving the
          usability, accessibility, and pleasure of using an app, website or product.

              First I researched a veriety of smart objects and decieded I wanted to also follow the underlyng principle that the smart object and app must provide geniuine value to the world.  This underlying principle lead me to the medical feild where a smart object and paired app could benifit people.s health and wellbeing.
              <br><br>
              I then researched at length, dementia, alzhiemers, caretakers,
              statistics on elders who become lost and best practices for finding
              lost elders. This help me understand the potential needs of my user.

                I took my research and applied it to my user stories to get a
                diverse set of user needs and narrow down my target audience.
                I created an empathy map to understand what my users says, does,
                thinks and how they feel. From this I can gain insight into a day i
                n the life of my user which helps me understand them emotionaly.
                <br><br>
                Using the insights I have gained I prioritize a list of needs
                that will later be used to mold the features and functions of my app.
