        <p class="soon"><strong>Ruby provides immense value </strong> and meaning
          because the issue of elder safety and wellbeing affects the whole of society
          and brings to front an important moral debate about privacy and safety.
          I have a personal connection to the issue of Dementia and Alzheimer's disease as
          two of my grandparents suffered its effect in the later stages of their lives.
