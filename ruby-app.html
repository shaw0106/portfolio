          <strong>The Challange:</strong> Create a smart object and design an
          Android app to accompany it following Material Design as a guideline. Then create a Behance page to show off the whole process.          <br>
          <br>

          <strong>The Solution: </strong>
            I chose to create and design an app that uses GPS tracking to help find elders who wander or get lost.
            <br><br>
            I have a personal connection to the issue of Dementia and Alzheimer's disease as
            two of my grandparents suffered its effect in the later stages of their lives and had the habit of wandering from the house.
