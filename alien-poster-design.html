          <p class="soon"><strong>Alien is an iconic movie that resonated tension and fear </strong> with every passing moment.
            I chose to use Alien as my movie poster redesign because I wanted to recreate the tension of the film and update the iconic original poster.
            <br>
            Using my technical skills I created this poster in Photoshop from images using filters and effects, starting from several sketched ideas.

            <p class="soon"> 	I started with a mind map of ideas for how I could
              represent the movie in poster form. I narrowed it down to four ideas that
              spoke the most to the original movie and sketched them out. When it came time to 	produce the poster
              it was a challenge to find photos that were 300 dpi and not grainy because the film was made in the 70s.
              <br><br>
              My final poster reflects this challenge as the lack of humans became
              the focal point of the tension and leave you wondering where is every
              one? This fit perfectly with the tone of the movie and the tag line
              that was prominent on the original poster, “In space no one can hear you scream.”
