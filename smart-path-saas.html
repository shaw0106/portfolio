      <p class="soon"><strong>The Challange: </strong> Design and code a SAAS website that is 100% responsive.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>The Solution: </strong> SMART-PATH is SAAS that teaches users of all skill levels to code, html, css, javascript, yaml, and more.
        After extensive research I decieded to target a high-income market of users who are looking to advance their careers in programming. I used a monochromatice
        colour palette to stand out from my competition. I created a brand that used the logos 3 round cornered square as its cornerstone and followed this through by
        creating buttons and images in the same shape.<br><br>
