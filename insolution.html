          <strong>The Challange: </strong> Create and design an
          Android app that includes a wearable such as a watch. Then create a presentation board to show off the whole process.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>The Solution: </strong> From my research I gathered that diabetics want to be in
          control of their health. I created Insolution to sync with a smart watch
          that logs and records data such as, sleep, glucose levels and exercise.
          <br>
          <br>
          The user records their mood, insulin intake and calories and can view
          the data on the dashboard in order to compare and understand the relationship between each health factor.
          <br>
          <br>
          For the final hand-in we were tasked with creating a presentaion board in order to collect feedback on the effectiveness of the app and the visual design.
