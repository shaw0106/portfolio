          <p class="soon"><strong>The Challange: </strong> Create an ios app that students could use to improve their lives.

            <br><br>
            <strong>The Solution:</strong> I conducted a survey for students to
            understand their anxieties and fears in order to create an app that could help them solve these problems. Through this survey I discovered that a vast majority of
            students were worried about their readiness to interview for jobs.
            <br><br>
             Using this
            information I could then ideate possible solutions to the problem statement
            and research the competition in order to create a vibrant, responsive app that will help students gain the skills and confidence to interview for their future jobs.

              To create an app that helps students I created a clean, simple hierarchy of information
              with strong iconography keeping the interactions simple.
              <br><br>
              Using a system of positive reinforcement combined with a gamified feature
              which allows the user to collect badges for progress, confidence will be
              gained through repetition and practice, and will give the user the upperhand in future interviews.
