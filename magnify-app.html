          <p class="soon">The objective of this project was to understand and
            empathize with the target audience, define user needs and insights,
            and establish a point-of-view and problem statement.
            <br><br>
             Using this
            information I could then ideate possible solutions to the problem statement
            and research the competition in order to create a vibrant, responsive app that will outsell the competition.

              To accomplish this I created a clean, simple hierarchy of information
              with strong iconography. Keeping options to a minimal and using a clear
              interface the user is successful in navigating to the area they are
              most concerned with strengthening.
              <br><br>
              Using a system of positive reinforcement combined with a gamified feature
              which allows the user to collect badges for progress, confidence will be
              gained through repetition and practice, and will give the user the upperhand in future interviews.
